Test on the VIRTUAL MACHINE.
Please run by ./Makefile
If you get permission error, please chmod u+x Makefile.
If the program doesn't run, please try again. I tested it on my virtual machine, it works.

Describe your enhancements:
1. Error handling in creating account and login page. Print appropriate
messages to remind users to input correct information.

2. Error handling in selecting courses page. If users select more than 5
courses, an appropriate error message is printed. If the course users
selected has time conflicts with already selected courses, an error
message will print to tell users what courses have time conflicts so
that users can adjust.

3. Add a logout button in the main window so that users can logout and
login with a different account. 

4. Users can save selected courses after clicking on the "Save" button.

5. My design for the UI is to make it as simple as possible. I believe
simplicity is beautiful and hard to reach.
